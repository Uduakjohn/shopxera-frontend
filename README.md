APP.JS

Shopxera is a responsive full eccomerce website
This code is a React application that uses the React Router library to handle client-side routing. It defines several routes for different pages of the application, such as the home page, about page, shop page, contact page, login page, signup page, forgot password page, cart page, checkout page, blog page, and product details page.

The 
App
 component is the main component that renders the application. It uses the 
BrowserRouter
 component to set up the routing system and the 
Routes
 component to define the different routes.

Each route is defined using the 
Route
 component, which takes a 
path
 prop and a 
element
 prop. The 
path
 prop specifies the URL path for the route, and the 
element
 prop specifies the component to render when the route is matched.

The 
Layout
 component is a common component that is rendered around each page of the application. It contains the common elements such as the header, footer, and navigation menu.

The 
ScrollToTop
 component is a custom component that is used to scroll to the top of the page when the user navigates to a new page.

The 
ShopContext
 component is a custom context that is used to share data between different components in the application.

Overall, this code sets up a basic React application with client-side routing and a common layout component.
